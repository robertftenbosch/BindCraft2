# BindCraft2

**Design protein binders around the biology of your experiment.**

BindCraft2 (BC2) brings de novo miniproteins, scaffolded binders, cyclic peptides and multistate design into one workflow. Describe your target, choose the kind of binder you want, and add properties that matter for your experiment. Named presets supply the design settings and acceptance filters; you can adjust individual settings when needed.

BC2 combines sequence optimisation through [AlphaFold 2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2) with [ProteinMPNN](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add2187) redesign, then evaluates candidates with separate AlphaFold models and structural filters. It returns sequences, predicted complexes and ranked results, with measurements of the interface, fold and molecular properties to help choose candidates for testing. These are computational designs: binding, selectivity and the requested biological behaviour require experimental validation.

[Installation](#installation) · [First design](#run-your-first-design) · [Your target](#design-against-your-own-target) · [Input tiers](#how-the-input-tiers-work) · [Modalities](#design-modalities) · [Properties](#additional-design-properties) · [Results](#read-your-results) · [Design guide](docs/source/design-guide.md) · [Settings](docs/source/reference.md) · [Outputs](docs/source/outputs.md) · [Installing and running](docs/source/installation.md)

## Installation

On Linux, start in a terminal without an active Python or Conda environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PacesaLab/BindCraft2.git
cd BindCraft2
bash install.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

In a new terminal, return to `BindCraft2` and run `source .venv/bin/activate` again. See the [installation and running guide](docs/source/installation.md) for existing environments, older GPUs, clusters, containers and troubleshooting.

## Run your first design

From the repository root, with the environment active:

```bash
bindcraft design examples/pdl1.json
```

The [PD-L1 input file](examples/pdl1.json) selects the shipped [hPDL1 target](settings/target/hPDL1.json) and requests 10 accepted binders and sets `"project_folder": "results/pdl1"` for the output. BC2 continues until it reaches that number, with no limit on design attempts.

To design VHHs against the same target, with the humanization property enabled:

```bash
bindcraft design examples/pdl1.json --modality VHH --humanize --set 'project_folder=results/pdl1_vhh'
```

This changes the binder format and saves the new experiment in `results/pdl1_vhh/`.

## Design against your own target

Put your target structure beside a file called `design.json`. This complete input requests a de novo binder to chain A of `target.pdb`:

```json
{
  "targets": [{"name": "my_target", "target_path": "target.pdb", "chains": "A"}],
  "modality": "binder",
  "binder_lengths": [80, 80],
  "number_of_final_designs": 10,
  "project_folder": "results/my_target"
}
```

```bash
bindcraft design design.json
```

Change `target.pdb` and `A` to match your structure, then choose your binder length and how many accepted designs you want.

- **Length:** `[80, 80]` requests exactly 80 residues; `[60, 100]` allows any length in that range. For a scaffolded format such as `VHH`, remove `binder_lengths` and change `modality`; the scaffold determines the length.
- **Binding site:** add `"hotspots": "54,56,66-70"` inside the target entry, using residue numbers from your structure.
- **Output:** `project_folder` names the results folder. Launching this example from `BindCraft2` writes to `BindCraft2/results/my_target/`. Give each experiment its own folder.

For a shipped target, replace the `targets` entry with `"target": "hPDL1"`. List the available targets with `bindcraft design --list-targets`.

BC2 accepts PDB, mmCIF and FASTA inputs. See [target and scaffold settings](docs/source/reference.md#define-the-target-and-binder) for chain selections, custom scaffolds and sequence targets.

## How the input tiers work

**You write one campaign file.** BC2 layers the shipped baseline, an optional core profile, your chosen modality and properties, and any named target under the entries in that file. Each layer below overrides the one above it, so a target's own settings beat the generic modality and property defaults, and your campaign beats them all.

| Layer | What it provides | What you write |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Core** — [settings/core/default.json](settings/core/default.json) | The baseline settings every campaign starts from. | Nothing. |
| **Core profile** — [settings/core/](settings/core/) | An opt-in profile applied under every preset, such as `benchmark` for a reproducible run. | `"core": "benchmark"`, or `--core benchmark`. |
| **Modality** — [settings/modality/](settings/modality/) | The binder format or conformational objective. | `"modality": "VHH"`. |
| **Properties** — [settings/property/](settings/property/) | Optional properties such as humanization or accessible termini. | `"humanize": true`. |
| **Target** — [settings/target/](settings/target/) | A shipped target, including its structure and binding-site selections; its settings win over the modality and property defaults. | `"target": "hPDL1"`, or write your own `targets` entry. |
| **Your campaign** | Desired number of designs, output folder and any adjustments. | Your JSON entries, or `--set 'name=value'`. |

**Your explicit settings take precedence over presets.** Command-line choices override matching entries in your JSON file. For example:

```bash
bindcraft design examples/pdl1.json --set 'binder_lengths=[70,90]' --set 'project_folder=results/pdl1_70_90'
```

`bindcraft design -h` names the settings changed most often, and `--list-settings` names every one of
them.

Edit the JSON file for a persistent choice, or use the command line for a one-off change:

| In your JSON file | On the command line |
| --- | --- |
| `"modality": "VHH"` | `--modality VHH` |
| `"forced_targeting": true` | `--forced-targeting` |
| `"humanize": true` | `--humanize` |
| `"termini_accessible": true` | `--termini-accessible` |

Use the exact names shown here, including capitals and underscores. `bindcraft design --help` lists the available targets, modalities and property flags. Start from [pdl1.json](examples/pdl1.json) when choosing presets; the other [example campaigns](examples/README.md) contain more specific settings that still take precedence when you add a preset. See [input tiers and overrides](docs/source/reference.md#input-tiers-and-overrides) for details.

## Design modalities

Choose a binder format, then add compatible targeting or conformational options. Each name links to the preset used by the code.

### Binder format

| Design goal | `--modality` name | When to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **De novo binder** | [binder](settings/modality/binder.json) | A new, independently folded protein binder without a starting scaffold. |
| **Larger binder** | [large_binder](settings/modality/large_binder.json) | Binders over 300 amino acids. Set your desired `binder_lengths`. |
| **Linear peptide** | [peptide](settings/modality/peptide.json) | Short binders below 25 amino acids that may fold only when bound. |
| **Cyclic peptide** | [cyclic_peptide](settings/modality/cyclic_peptide.json) | A short peptide intended for head-to-tail cyclisation. |
| **Homo-oligomer** | [homo_oligomer](settings/modality/homo_oligomer.json) | An assembly of identical binder chains. Set `copies` for the number of chains. |
| **Multidomain binder** | [multidomain](settings/modality/multidomain.json) | Several domains connected within one binder chain. |
| **VHH** | [VHH](settings/modality/VHH.json) | A single-domain antibody (VHH) binder built from a VHH scaffold. |
| **Ankyrin Repeat protein (ARP)** | [ARP](settings/modality/ARP.json) | A binder built from a consensus ankyrin-repeat scaffold. |
| **scFv variable domains** | [scFv](settings/modality/scFv.json) | Paired antibody variable domains. BC2 models two chains; the connecting linker must be designed separately. |
| **Fab** | [Fab](settings/modality/Fab.json) | An antibody-binding fragment with heavy and light chains, including their constant domains. |

The antibody and ARP presets use supplied [scaffolds](scaffolds/). See [scaffold editing](docs/source/reference.md#define-the-target-and-binder) to use your own.

### Target recognition

Most targeting choices are made in the `targets` entries of your JSON file:

| Design goal | What to write | Detailed example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **One binder for several targets** | Use `"target": ["hPDL1", "mPDL1"]` for shipped targets, or add each protein under `targets`. | [Human/mouse PD-L1](examples/pdl1_ortholog_pair.json) |
| **Avoid a specified off-target** | Add the off-target under `targets` with `"objective": "detarget"`. | [PD-L1 with PD-1 detargeting](examples/pdl1_detarget_pd1.json) |
| **Keep a target region free** | Add `coldspots` to its target entry, using input residue numbers. | [IL-7Rα patch](examples/il7ra_focused_epitope.json) |
| **Bind a peptide or disordered target** | Point `target_path` to a FASTA file. Choose the binder format separately. | [Dynorphin A](examples/dynorphin_idr.json) |
| **Bind a receptor assembly** | Select its chains with `"chains": "A,B"`; use chain-prefixed hotspots such as `"A54,B12-16"`. | [IL-2 receptor](examples/il2_receptor.json) |

For a **focused epitope**, add [--forced-targeting](settings/property/forced_targeting.json) and name `hotspots` on a structured target. See [targeting options](docs/source/reference.md#targeting-options) for the method and acceptance criteria.

### Conformational design

| Design goal | `--modality` name | When to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Interface movement on binding** | [induced_fit](settings/modality/induced_fit.json) | A binder whose binding surface changes shape between the free and bound states. |
| **Whole-fold change on binding** | [fold_switch](settings/modality/fold_switch.json) | A binder intended to adopt different folds when free and bound. |

These presets each use **one target**. Combine one with a compatible binder format, for example `--modality binder,induced_fit`. [Conformational design details](docs/source/reference.md#conformational-design) cover the structural criteria and designs with explicit groups of conformations.

### Additional design properties

Add a compatible property as a command-line flag or a top-level JSON entry:

| Property | Command-line flag | JSON entry |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Focused epitope** — concentrate binding on named hotspots | `--forced-targeting` | `"forced_targeting": true` |
| **Humanization** — favour human-like, lower immunogenicity, sequence features (*in development*) | `--humanize` | `"humanize": true` |
| **Protease resistance** — reduce predicted cleavage susceptibility | `--protease-stable` | `"protease_stable": true` |
| **Disulfide staple** — include a predicted disulfide bond | `--disulfide-staple` | `"disulfide_staple": true` |
| **Mixed topology** — select for beta-sheet content and limit helicity | `--mixed-topology` | `"mixed_topology": true` |
| **Nearby termini** — bring the N and C termini together | `--termini-together` | `"termini_together": true` |
| **Accessible termini** — direct both chain ends away from the target | `--termini-accessible` | `"termini_accessible": true` |
| **Initial guess** — re-predict each candidate from the pose the trajectory folded | `--initial-guess` | `"initial_guess": true` |
| **Big bang** — seed the gradient stages too, so a binder folded from nothing starts at the origin | `--bigbang` | `"bigbang": true` |

For example:

```bash
bindcraft design examples/pdl1.json --mixed-topology --set 'project_folder=results/pdl1_mixed'
```

These properties are judged using computational proxies. See [property objectives and acceptance filters](docs/source/reference.md#property-objectives-and-acceptance-filters) for what each one measures and requires, and [starting conformations](docs/source/reference.md#starting-conformations) for the optional `--initial-guess` and `--bigbang` flags.

### Combining modalities

![Compatibility of binder design modalities: supported combinations in green, unsupported combinations in red](docs/.assets/modality_compatibility.png)

The chart shows compatible pairs of biological design objectives. The named `fold_switch` preset still requires one target; see [conformational design](docs/source/reference.md#conformational-design). BC2 checks declared incompatibilities before starting a campaign.

## Continue a campaign

A campaign resumes by default: run it again against the same folder and it carries on, claiming the trajectories it has not run yet, which is what a timed-out session or a second process added for a GPU relies on.

```bash
bindcraft design examples/pdl1.json
```

Repeat any additional flags used to start that run. Add `--set 'resume=false'` to refuse a non-empty folder instead. See [campaign records](docs/source/reference.md#resolved-settings-and-reproducibility) for reproducibility and optional author or project metadata.

To stop a campaign that is running, ask it to pause. Every worker finishes the trajectory it is designing, records it, and then shuts down, so a pause costs no GPU time already spent:

```bash
bindcraft pause results/pdl1
bindcraft resume results/pdl1
```

`Ctrl+C` in the terminal running the campaign asks for the same pause, which is what to use rather than killing it: interrupting a second time gives up on the trajectory in flight. `bindcraft resume` reads the settings the campaign recorded, so neither the settings file nor the flags have to be typed again.

## Read your results

Start with `results/pdl1/3_Ranked/!_Ranked.csv`, then inspect the structures beside it. The three result folders follow the design process:

```text
results/pdl1/
  1_Trajectories/   design attempts and their optimisation records
  2_Refolded/       redesigned sequences, predicted complexes and filter outcomes
  3_Ranked/         accepted designs, ranked for selection
```

| Output | What to use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `3_Ranked/!_Ranked.csv` | Accepted designs ordered by `i_pDAE`, a distance-masked interface confidence score. Compare confidence, contacts, sequence and molecular properties before selecting candidates. |
| `3_Ranked/*.cif` | Predicted complex structures in mmCIF format. Check the binding pose, epitope access and fit to the biological assembly. Multitarget designs have a complex for each target. |
| `2_Refolded/!_Refolded.csv` | Scored ProteinMPNN candidates, including rejections and the filters they failed. |
| `2_Refolded/*.cif` | Predicted complexes for redesigned sequences, including failed candidates by default. |
| `1_Trajectories/!_Trajectories.csv` | A record of each design attempt, its final metrics and where it stopped. |
| `1_Trajectories/<design>/` | Optimisation records for individual attempts, with optional structures, plots and animations. |
| `campaign_metadata.json` | Resolved settings, model choices, source revision, checkpoint hashes and your metadata. |

A stage folder appears when its first file is written. If no designs have been accepted yet, start with the earlier stages to see their progress and filter outcomes.

To see a campaign whole, write its report:

```bash
bindcraft report results/pdl1
```

It prints its own conclusions to the terminal and writes `report.html` beside the tables: where the campaign loses its designs, which threshold does the rejecting and by how far every reading misses it, the stage trajectories stop at, how the optimisation ran, and the accepted designs with their structures. The page is one self-contained file with no plotting library behind it, so it can be written on a compute node and copied anywhere to read. Its 3D viewer is fetched from a CDN when the page is opened online; offline the structures are still named for opening in PyMOL or ChimeraX, and `--structures 0` leaves them out of the file.

To rank by another measurement or explore different acceptance thresholds:

```bash
bindcraft rank results/pdl1 --on i_pTM
bindcraft filter results/pdl1
```

The filter command reports which criteria rejected candidates. See [ranking and refiltering](docs/source/outputs.md#ranking-and-refiltering) for choosing new thresholds and saving a revised shortlist without running design again.

Confidence scores are not binding affinities. For cropped targets, inspect the binder against the full structure; for cell-surface targets, consider glycans, membrane orientation and access by other proteins. The [output and measurement reference](docs/source/outputs.md) explains every file and every measurement.
